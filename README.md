# AblyiOSJSPerformanceTest

This project is meant to study and compare the performance of iOS and JS SDKs in sending and receiving messages.

JS is in general faster than iOS. You can notice the difference in printing received messages in the consoles but it's even clearer when you look at the measured delays.
